# CFD with AR/VR 
**Multiplatform processing of CFD simulations with AR/VR**

The provided codes process CFD simulation data from multiple solver (e.g. OpenFOAM, Ansys Fluent and COMSOL) to integrate extract-based CFD results in cross-platform development environments such as game engines. It is written in Python using ParaView and Blender APIs. 

The goal herewith is to provide a simple, easy-to-implement and free-to-use data processor to utilize CFD results in AR/VR environments. The code mostly provides a sample of existing CFD datasets. Minor costumizations might be required.

To execute the code, you must build an Anaconda application with ParaView and Blender.
