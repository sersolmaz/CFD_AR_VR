# CFD with AR/VR
**Multiplatform processing of CFD simulations with AR/VR**

The provided code processes CFD simulation data from multiple solver to integrate extract-based results in cross-platform development environments such as game engines. It is written in Python. The goal herewith is to provide a simple, easy-to-implement and free-to-use data processor to utilize CFD results in AR/VR environments.

Therefore, it can be easily modified to test techniques in the different steps of wireless transmission. The main folder contains two subfolders:

All the code files needed to simulate a wireless transmission using 802.11p are located in the folder code.

To execute the code, you must run the Selec_grap.m file that presents three options: Simulated PHY graph Graph of the theoretical models Graphic comparison of PHY and theoretical models

Necessary datasets are included so that Selec_grap.m runs without any inconvenience. If you want to re-simulate the physical layer, you must first run the file simulation_802_11_p.m and then proceed to run Selec_grap.m

This version includes a realistic channel model for vehicular communications

The folder html contains the user manual with the commented code. You must run the Selec_grap.html file that is the main one.
